## Start ngenCERF
This connects to the ngenCERF service as a PW [interactive session](https://github.com/parallelworks/interactive_session/blob/main/README.md).

**Usage Instructions:**
- Launch this workflow on the shared cluster where the `ngencerf_start` workflow is already running.
- The workflow establishes an SSH tunnel for secure access to the UI from the platform.
